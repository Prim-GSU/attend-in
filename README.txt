After adding the WITH in the tokens WITH was then added in the regular expression.
In WAEParser.py for single WITH expression 
Single with 'wae: LBRACE WITH wae wae RBRACE'.
After the first WITH expression - 'wae : LBRACE wae wae RBRACE'.
After writing the WITH expression next part was assigning values to x. Parser creates the list first after creating the list in WAE.py if and else conditions were written for WITH. Next Recursive code was written to deal with the WITH expression. It checks for the first with then next goes to the sub list which has another with so until the exit condition it recursively calls the WITH expression.
