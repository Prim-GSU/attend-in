    <h1>Buy Your Way to a Better Education up in Here!</h1>

    <p>
        Life itself is your professor, and you are in a state of constant learning, now there are 3 kinds of people in
        the world: people that can count and people that can't count. Which of the three are you?. That's right! All you
        need to get a 4.0 in this course. My education is about learning what you didn't know even if know you that
        didn't know. <br /><br />

        'Do you need homework today I think so however the moment I forget to assign you homework there will be a
        scholar student to utter loudly 'We have homework...'
